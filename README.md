# dotFiles
My daily dotFiles configuration under construction for Arch Linux. Primarily, I'm initiating to post i3 configuration, but I'll upload some configuration files for KDE too. At the first time, I'll stay with this one repository, but in the future, I can make another repository to upload different desktops.

# bash and zsh configuration

Just uploaded more three archived named as .zshrc, .bashrc and .profile which integrate with bash and zsh. Also, uploaded a aliasrc under .config directory under construction.

# redshift configuration

This configuration is pretty straightforward here, but anyway, let me explain more how you can setup this redshift configuration. Considering that you already clonned my own repository, already installed redshift on your linux distribution and using a common service manager named as SystemD, just use this command: $ systemctl --user enable --now redshift.service

Also, using KDE you can use a plasmoid applet to simple configure and toggle redshift on whatever you want on this application.

# scripts directory

Nice directory containing some scripts which can do cool tasks pretty easy with less effort.
